Segmentation Corpora Formats
============================


JSON masses
------------
Each *.json file represents annotations for one item (i.e., a document) stored using UTF-8 encoded JSON ([JavaScript Object Notation](http://www.json.org/)) format.  In each JSON file is a list of annotators followed by a sequence of the inner segments with numbers representing their sizes (e.g., figure below).

<pre>
              --------------
Annotator 1: |  2 | 1|   3  |   =>   { 1 : [2, 1, 3] }
              --------------
</pre>


TSV masses
------------
Each *.tsv file represents annotations for one item (i.e., a document) stored using UTF-8 encoded TSV (tabbed separated values) format.  In each TSV file is a column representing the annotator number followed by (for each row following the first column) a sequence of the inner segments with numbers representing their sizes (e.g., figure shown below).

<pre>
              --------------
Annotator 1: |  2 | 1|   3  |   =>    1    2    1    3
              --------------
</pre>
