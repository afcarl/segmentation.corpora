This repository holds multiply segmented corpora from the papers below.  The data formats are as specified in the [Segmentation Representation Specifcation Version 1.1](http://nlp.chrisfournier.ca/publications/pdf/fournier_segeval_spec_2012.pdf)(PDF), and are of two types:

- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or
